# @mastra/code-sdk

The agent core behind [Mastra Code](https://mastra.ai) — everything except the terminal UI. Use it to build your own UIs and surfaces (web apps, editors, bots) on top of the Mastra Code coding agent.

The published [`mastracode`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mastracode) CLI/TUI and the Mastra Code web surface are both built on this SDK.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @mastra/code-sdk
```

## Usage

Mount the Mastra Code agent controller on a Mastra instance:

```ts
import { mountAgentControllerOnMastra } from '@mastra/code-sdk';

// Creates a Mastra instance that hosts the Mastra Code agent controller
// (thread management, modes, tools, memory) and starts its workers.
const { mastra, controller } = await mountAgentControllerOnMastra({
  cwd: process.cwd(),
});
```

To construct the `Mastra` instance yourself (e.g. in a deployable `mastra` entry file), use `prepareAgentControllerMount`:

```ts
import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core/mastra';
import { prepareAgentControllerMount } from '@mastra/code-sdk';

const prepared = await prepareAgentControllerMount({ cwd: process.cwd() });

export const mastra = new Mastra(prepared.mastraArgs);

await prepared.finalize();
```

### Add input processors

Embedding surfaces can prepend stateless input processors without replacing Mastra Code's required policy and compatibility processors:

```ts
const phaseProcessor = {
  id: 'current-phase',
  async processInputStep({ messages }) {
    await reconcileCompletedTools(messages);
  },
};

const prepared = await prepareAgentControllerMount({
  cwd: process.cwd(),
  inputProcessors: [phaseProcessor],
});
```

Configured processors run before Mastra Code's built-in input processors. Keep processor instances stateless because the mounted agent shares them across sessions and runs.

## Dynamic workflows

The local controller registers the Workflow Builder before workers start. In build mode, users can ask the code agent to create a workflow in natural language. The builder discovers registered agents, tools, and workflows, validates a complete definition, then persists and registers it immediately.

Use the workflow service to manage saved workflows from a custom SDK surface:

```ts
import { deleteWorkflow, getWorkflow, listWorkflows, runWorkflow } from '@mastra/code-sdk/workflows/service';

const { workflows } = await listWorkflows(mastra);
const firstWorkflow = workflows[0];
if (!firstWorkflow) throw new Error('No Dynamic Workflows are available.');

const definition = await getWorkflow(mastra, firstWorkflow.id);
if (!definition) throw new Error(`Workflow "${firstWorkflow.id}" was not found.`);

const result = await runWorkflow(mastra, definition.id, { topic: 'dynamic workflows' });
await deleteWorkflow(mastra, definition.id);
```

Pass the session request context to `runWorkflow` when workflow agent steps need the session-selected model. You can also pass an event callback as the fifth argument to render workflow step progress.

Deep modules are available as subpath imports, e.g.:

```ts
import { loadSettings } from '@mastra/code-sdk/onboarding/settings';
```

> The subpath API surface is still evolving and may change between minor releases while the package is pre-1.0.
