# mastracode-web

The Mastra Code web host: API routes (config/fs/GitHub/Linear), a deployable Mastra entry (`src/mastra/index.ts`), and server/controller scenario tests. Production builds and generated Factory projects use the versioned SPA bundled with the Mastra CLI. [`mastracode/factory-ui`](../factory-ui) remains the independent internal browser application for Vite-based UI development. Built on [`@mastra/code-sdk`](../sdk). One factory storage backend persists agent state (threads, messages, and memory) and web app data. When `DATABASE_URL` is set, a separate `PgVector` uses the same PostgreSQL database for recall search; explicit local development and test runs use the SDK's local LibSQL database without vector storage. (`APP_DATABASE_URL` is honored as a deprecated fallback.)

This is a **standalone pnpm project** (own lockfile, not a monorepo workspace member). For development, the monorepo-provided packages (`@mastra/*`, `mastra`) are consumed via `link:` specs pointing at the monorepo directories, so you always develop against local source. For builds, `scripts/monorepo-deps.mjs` temporarily pins every declared `link:` dependency to the exact version found in the monorepo (see below).

## Setup

```bash
# from the monorepo root
pnpm install

# in mastracode/web
pnpm install
```

## Development

For the integrated Factory server and its bundled UI:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

For UI design work with Vite HMR, run the API and SPA separately:

```bash
# terminal 1 — in mastracode/web
pnpm api

# terminal 2 — in mastracode/factory-ui
pnpm web
```

Open **http://localhost:5173**. The Factory API runs on **:4111**; the Vite SPA
proxies `/api`, `/web`, and `/auth/` to it. The `api` script sets
`MASTRACODE_PUBLIC_URL` to the Vite origin so local OAuth callbacks return to
the browser UI. The UI script reads the host `.env` through `MASTRACODE_ENV_DIR`.

Local development works without PostgreSQL: the full web surface uses the SDK's local LibSQL database. To exercise the PostgreSQL backend and distributed-lock path, run `pnpm db:up` before `pnpm api`.

## Build & deploy

```bash
pnpm build
```

1. `prebuild` builds linked monorepo packages with Turbo.
2. `scripts/monorepo-deps.mjs run -- mastra build --dir src/mastra` pins `link:` dependencies to the exact monorepo versions, bundles the API server into `.mastra/output/`, copies the Factory SPA bundled with the CLI, and restores the `link:` specs afterward, including on failure or interruption.
3. The Factory server serves the CLI-bundled SPA artifact same-origin at `/`.

Run the output with `pnpm start` (or `node .mastra/output/index.mjs` after installing output dependencies).

To deploy to Mastra Cloud:

```bash
pnpm deploy
```

This builds and validates the output, then runs `mastra deploy --skip-build` to upload the existing `.mastra/output`. Deploy targets `--env production` by default and auto-selects `.env.production` if present; otherwise it offers to upload variables from the local `.env`. Requires `mastra auth login` first; pass extra flags with `pnpm deploy -- --env staging`.

## Tests

```bash
pnpm test     # host unit and server/controller scenario tests
```

UI MSW tests (`*.msw.test.tsx`) and unit tests live in [`mastracode/factory-ui`](../factory-ui). Run them with `pnpm --filter ./mastracode/factory-ui test` (or `test:unit` / `test:msw` for focused suites).

## Factories, bindings, and repositories

In the Web UI, a **Factory** is the top-level product entity that a user creates and selects. Each Factory has one binding:

- **Local folder**: A path on the host machine. Sessions use the `resourceId` resolved by `GET /web/codebase/resolve`.
- **Server Factory**: A persisted Factory project identified by `factoryProjectId`. It can contain one or more connected repositories. Repository-specific operations use each repository's `projectRepositoryId`.

Factory work items belong to the Factory project. Sandboxes, worktrees, GitHub issue and pull request feeds, and pull request subscriptions belong to a connected repository. Private HTTP routes reflect that split. Work items use `/web/factory/projects/:factoryProjectId/*`, while GitHub provider operations use `/web/github/projects/:projectRepositoryId/*`.

Session continuity with the terminal user interface (TUI) keeps the Software Development Kit (SDK) names `projectPath` and `detectProject`. These names refer to the execution workspace path and codebase detection protocol, not the Factory product entity.

Intake source config is asymmetric by provider. GitHub selections use `repositoryIds`, which contain connected repository UUIDs. Linear selections use `projectIds` because a Linear Project is an external provider concept.

Browser state uses `mastracode-factories`. The active Factory comes from the `/factories/:factoryId/**` URL, and prerelease `mastracode-projects` keys aren't read.

## Work and Review workflows

Server-backed Factories split repository work across two boards:

- **Work** (`/factories/:factoryId/work`): Shows manual work items, GitHub issues, and Linear issues. Its stages are **Intake**, **Triage**, **Planning**, **Building**, **Review**, and **Done**.
- **Review** (`/factories/:factoryId/review`): Shows GitHub pull requests only. Its stages are **Intake**, **Reviewing**, and **Done**.

Open GitHub issues appear as **Work** intake candidates. Open pull requests appear as **Review** intake candidates. Adding a candidate to a board creates or updates its persisted Factory work item. The source type determines which board owns that item, so a GitHub issue can't appear on **Review** and a pull request can't appear on **Work**.

When a Factory pull request branch matches a related work session branch, the Review item stores the Work item as its parent. The Work card links to the Review session, and the Review card links back to the Work session. The same reciprocal links appear in the session header. Links to a thread are shown only while its referenced worktree still exists; the related board item remains available after worktree deletion.

## Workspace skill invocation

The private Web API can activate a user-invocable skill on an existing scoped AgentController session with `POST /web/agent-controller/:controllerId/skills/invoke`. The Web Factory packages workflow skills such as `understand-issue` and `understand-pr` as ordinary, read-only `SKILL.md` files and adds them only to workspaces created by `MastraFactory`; the shared SDK and TUI workspace resolver do not load them. The route resolves every ID through the session workspace, uses the same `<skill name="…">` activation envelope as `/skill/<name>` in the TUI, and returns an error without dispatching when the skill is missing. Authenticated requests may target only the caller's personal session or a Factory worktree owned by that organization user.

## Factory metrics

The **Metrics** page at `/factories/:factoryId/metrics` shows queue health for the active Factory. The Queue Health Chart contains one horizontal bar per Work stage. Each bar is segmented by item age and overlays diagonal stripes where agent work is active. Selecting a segment filters the item list below the chart. Age comes from the open `stageHistory` entry and falls back to `createdAt`. The pure `computeQueueHealth()` function in `mastracode/factory-ui/src/ui/domains/factory/queue-health.ts` performs the client-side aggregation.

Queue age thresholds are server-side Factory project config in seconds. `GET /web/factory/projects/:factoryProjectId/health/thresholds` reads them from the `queue-health` storage domain. The `queue_health_settings` table keys records by `(org_id, factory_project_id)`. Defaults are `[14400, 86400, 259200]` (4h, 24h, and 72h). `saveConfig` rejects empty or non-ascending `thresholdsSeconds` values.

## Factory rules

`MastraFactory` accepts one authoritative `rules` tree for Work and Review stage entry and exit, completed tool results, and normalized GitHub events. Construct it with `defaultFactoryRules()` so every deployment policy has an explicit version:

```ts
import { MastraFactory } from '@mastra/factory';
import { defaultFactoryRules } from '@mastra/factory/rules';

const rules = defaultFactoryRules({
  version: '2026-07-18.1',
  overrides: {
    review: {
      intake: {
        pullRequest: {
          onEnter: context =>
            context.actor.type === 'github' && !context.actor.trusted
              ? { type: 'reject', code: 'forbidden', reason: 'A trusted author is required.' }
              : undefined,
        },
      },
    },
    tools: {
      submit_plan: {
        onResult: () => undefined,
      },
    },
  },
});

const factory = new MastraFactory({ rules });
```

Overrides replace the exact `onEnter`, `onExit`, `onResult`, or `onEvent` leaf; they never compose implicitly with another handler. The version is configuration identity for persisted evaluations and audits, not an event-deduplication key, and Mastra never hashes function source.

Rules are trusted deployment code. They receive normalized, bounded context rather than storage handles, credentials, worktree paths, or raw webhook payloads. Each handler returns one bounded `FactoryRuleDecision` or `void`: a typed rejection, transition, linked-item upsert, skill invocation, bound-session message, or notification. Every returned decision is validated and redacted before persistence; external effects are deferred rather than executed inside rule evaluation.

## GitHub pull request notifications

GitHub-backed Factory sessions automatically subscribe the current thread after a successful `gh pr create`. The `github_subscribe_pr` tool is primarily for existing pull requests or recovery when automatic subscription did not occur. Use `github_unsubscribe_pr` only to stop notifications early; closing or merging the pull request retires its subscription automatically.

Configure the GitHub App webhook URL as `https://your-host/web/github/webhook`, set `GITHUB_APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to the same secret configured in GitHub, and subscribe the App to pull request, pull request review, pull request review comment, and issue comment events. Comments and reviews are delivered only when their author has write access or is an explicitly authorized bot.

## Environment

See `.env.schema` (package root; varlock validates `.env` against it). Local development needs no variables and runs auth-less with local LibSQL storage; non-local deployments require `DATABASE_URL` (or the deprecated `APP_DATABASE_URL`). WorkOS auth requires both `WORKOS_API_KEY` and `WORKOS_CLIENT_ID`; alternatively set `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`. GitHub needs the complete `GITHUB_APP_*` group plus auth; Linear needs `LINEAR_CLIENT_ID` and `LINEAR_CLIENT_SECRET`; Railway sandboxes need `RAILWAY_API_TOKEN`. `MASTRACODE_PUBLIC_URL` controls the WorkOS (`/auth/callback`), GitHub App (`/auth/github/callback`), and Linear callback URLs.
