# Mastra Code

A coding agent that never compacts. Built with [Mastra](https://mastra.ai) and [pi-tui](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono).

Learn more in the [documentation](https://code.mastra.ai/) and [announcement post](https://mastra.ai/blog/announcing-mastra-code).

![Screenshot of the Mastra Code TUI. At the top it shows in green letters "Mastra Code". It then displays the version, project, resource ID, and user. The user and assistant message have green borders. At the bottom is a green input field. Below the input is on the left the current mode and model displayed. In the middle the Observational Memory status is shown. On the right is the current directory.](https://res.cloudinary.com/mastra-assets/image/upload/v1778048981/mastracode-init_tny2pb.png)

## Features

- **Observational Memory built-in**: Never deal with compaction again. [Observational Memory](https://mastra.ai/docs/memory/observational-memory) automatically extracts and stores observations from every conversation, then injects relevant context into future requests.
- **Multi-model support**: Use Claude, GPT, Gemini, and thousands of other models via Mastra's unified model router
- **OAuth login**: Authenticate with Anthropic (Claude Max) and OpenAI (ChatGPT Plus/Codex)
- **Persistent conversations**: Threads are saved per-project and resume automatically
- **Coding tools**: View files, edit code, run shell commands
- **Dynamic workflows**: Build workflows through chat, then list, inspect, run, and delete them from the TUI
- **Goals**: Pursue longer-running objectives with configurable judge models and goal-enabled commands/skills
- **Plan persistence**: Approved plans are saved as markdown files for future reference
- **Token tracking**: Monitor usage with persistent token counts per thread
- **Beautiful TUI**: Polished terminal interface with streaming responses

## Installation

Install `mastracode` globally with your package manager of choice.

```bash
npm install -g mastracode
```

If you prefer not to install packages globally, you can use `npx`:

```bash
npx mastracode
```

On first launch, an interactive onboarding wizard guides you through:

1. **Authentication**: Log in with your AI provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.)
2. **Model packs**: Choose default models for each mode (build / plan / fast)
3. **Observational Memory**: Pick a model for OM (learns about you over time)
4. **YOLO mode**: Auto-approve tool calls, or require manual confirmation

You can re-run setup anytime with `/setup`.

## Prerequisites

### Optional: `fd` for file autocomplete

The `@` file autocomplete feature uses [`fd`](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd), a fast file finder that respects `.gitignore`. Without it, `@` autocomplete silently does nothing.

Install with your package manager:

```bash
# macOS
brew install fd

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install fd-find

# Arch
sudo pacman -S fd
```

On Ubuntu/Debian the binary is called `fdfind` — mastracode detects both `fd` and `fdfind` automatically.

## Usage

### Starting a conversation

Type your message and press Enter. If the agent is already working, Enter queues your next message and sends it after the current run finishes.

### `@` file references

Type `@` followed by a partial filename to fuzzy-search project files and reference them in your message. This requires `fd` to be installed (see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)).

- `@setup` — fuzzy-matches files like `setup.ts`, `setup.py`, etc.
- `@src/tui` — scoped search within a directory
- `@"path with spaces"` — quoted form for paths containing spaces

Select a suggestion with arrow keys and press Tab to insert it.

### Process memory diagnostics

Enable process memory diagnostics before startup when you need evidence for memory growth in a long-running TUI or headless process:

```bash
MASTRACODE_PROFILE=1 mastracode
```

> **Warning:** Allocation profiles can contain prompts, credentials, file contents, and tool arguments. Keep the output directory private, don't upload it as telemetry, and delete it after the investigation.

Use the same process-wide diagnostics instance from the TUI:

```text
/profile status
/profile start
/profile capture
/profile stop
```

Bare `/profile` is an alias for `/profile status`. Starting an active run preserves its original directory and configuration. `capture` persists a Chrome allocation-sampling profile and starts a new sampling epoch. It doesn't force garbage collection (GC) or write a heap snapshot. `stop` writes a final sample and allocation profile before releasing the profiler.

#### Configuration

| Environment variable                           | Default                           | Minimum | Description                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MASTRACODE_PROFILE`                           | Disabled                          | N/A     | Enables startup profiling for `1`, `true`, `yes`, or `on`   |
| `MASTRACODE_PROFILE_DIR`                       | `<Mastra Code app-data>/profiles` | N/A     | Parent directory for private, unique run directories        |
| `MASTRACODE_PROFILE_SAMPLE_INTERVAL_MS`        | `10000`                           | `1000`  | Process and V8 sample interval in milliseconds              |
| `MASTRACODE_PROFILE_CAPTURE_INTERVAL_MS`       | `300000`                          | `10000` | Durable allocation-profile capture interval in milliseconds |
| `MASTRACODE_PROFILE_ALLOCATION_INTERVAL_BYTES` | `524288`                          | `32768` | V8 allocation-sampling interval in bytes                    |

Truthy values are case-insensitive and may contain surrounding whitespace. Other values leave startup profiling disabled. When startup profiling is enabled, invalid numeric values produce an actionable warning and leave Mastra Code running without an active profiler.

Each run gets a unique directory under the configured parent with these files:

- `metadata.json`: Immutable runtime and configuration metadata
- `process-samples.jsonl`: Append-only RSS, JavaScript heap, external memory, ArrayBuffer memory, resource usage, and V8 heap-space samples
- `gc-events.jsonl`: Append-only GC kind, flags, duration, and nearby memory values when V8 emits GC performance entries. A run can contain zero events.
- `allocation-<sequence>-<timestamp>.heapprofile`: Atomic Chrome allocation-sampling profiles

Mastra Code requests mode `0700` for run directories and `0600` for files on POSIX systems. Other platforms may apply permissions differently.

Compare JavaScript heap growth with resident set size (RSS). Rising heap-space usage points to retained JavaScript objects. Rising RSS with a stable JavaScript heap can point to external buffers, ArrayBuffers, native libraries, memory-mapped files, or allocator behavior. Allocation profiles include objects collected by major and minor GC, which helps distinguish sustained retention from transient allocation pressure.

Sampling and periodic file writes add overhead. Larger allocation intervals and longer capture intervals reduce it. Manual capture briefly rotates the sampling epoch.

Atomically completed captures survive later `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`, `SIGHUP`, `SIGKILL`, or native crashes. The TUI writes a final capture for handled graceful signals and awaited fatal errors. Immediate `SIGKILL`, native crashes, power loss, and other abrupt termination can't guarantee a final capture, so the periodic capture interval protects those cases.

Delete the run directory when the investigation is complete. Never commit captured profiles.

### Dynamic workflows

Create a workflow by describing it in build-mode chat. For example:

```text
Build me a workflow that accepts a topic, researches it, and returns a concise summary.
```

Mastra Code discovers the registered agents, tools, and workflows, builds a complete workflow definition, validates it, and saves it for future sessions. Workflow creation is chat-driven; `/workflows` manages workflows that have already been saved.

```text
/workflows list
/workflows show research-summary
/workflows run research-summary {"topic":"dynamic workflows"}
/workflows delete research-summary
```

Run `/workflows help` for the full command reference.

### Plugins

Use `/plugins` to install and manage trusted local or GitHub plugins. Plugins can add tools, commands, skills, and system instructions. Because plugins execute code inside Mastra Code and their instructions are appended to the agent prompt, only install plugins from sources you trust.

### Goals

Use `/goal <objective>` to have Mastra Code keep working toward an objective across turns. Goals use a judge model to decide whether the goal is complete, should continue, or should wait for an explicit user checkpoint. Configure defaults with `/judge`.

Goal objectives can span multiple lines:

```text
/goal Fix the failing release checks
and open a PR when everything passes.
```

When a plan is submitted with `submit_plan`, the inline approval UI also includes **Use as /goal**. That saves/approves the plan and starts a goal using the plan text as the objective.

Custom slash commands can opt into goal mode with top-level frontmatter:

```md
---
name: pr-triage
description: Triage open PRs
goal: true
---

Inspect every open PR before pair-reviewing candidates.
```

Run goal-enabled commands with `/goal/<command-name>`. The processed command content becomes the goal objective, so `$ARGUMENTS` and other command template features still apply.

Skills can opt into goal mode with skill metadata:

```md
---
name: review-prs
description: Review pull requests
metadata:
  goal: true
---

Review PRs until all relevant candidates have been categorized.
```

Run goal-enabled skills with `/goal/<skill-name>`. Skill instructions become the goal objective; any extra arguments are included as context.

## Configuration

### Custom config directory

By default, Mastra Code reads and writes project config from `.mastracode/` and global config from `~/.mastracode/` plus `~/.config/mastracode/`.

If you embed Mastra Code programmatically, you can override that directory name with `createMastraCode({ configDir: '.your-config-dir' })`.

This remaps the project-level and global config locations that Mastra Code uses for MCP server configs, hooks, slash commands, agent instructions, skills, and the legacy `database.json` lookup.

```ts
import { createMastraCode } from 'mastracode';

const mastraCode = await createMastraCode({
  configDir: '.acme-code',
});
```

`configDir` must be a single directory name. Absolute paths, `.` / `..`, and names containing `/` or `\` are rejected.

### Project-based threads

Threads are automatically scoped to your project based on:

1. Git remote URL (if available)
2. Absolute path (fallback)

This means conversations are shared across clones, worktrees, and SSH/HTTPS URLs of the same repository.

### Database location

The SQLite database is stored in your system's application data directory:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/mastracode/`
- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/mastracode/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/mastracode/`

### Authentication

For **Anthropic** models, mastracode supports two authentication methods:

1. **Claude Max OAuth (primary)**: Use `/login` to authenticate with a Claude Pro/Max subscription.
2. **API key (fallback)**: Set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable for direct API access. This is used when not logged in via OAuth.

When both are available, Claude Max OAuth takes priority.

For **other providers** (OpenAI, Google, etc.), set the corresponding environment variable (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`) or use OAuth where supported.

For **Amazon Bedrock**, mastracode authenticates with AWS SigV4 through the standard AWS credential chain — environment variables (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` / `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`), a shared `~/.aws` profile (`AWS_PROFILE`, including SSO), or a container/instance role all work, the same resolution order as the AWS CLI. Set `AWS_REGION` (defaults to `us-east-1`) to choose a region. Select Bedrock models with the `amazon-bedrock/<modelId>` form, where `<modelId>` is any Bedrock model ID surfaced via `/models`. To use Bedrock API-key auth instead of SigV4, set `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`.

Credentials are stored alongside the database in `auth.json`.

### Custom providers and models

Use `/custom-providers` to manage OpenAI-compatible providers with:

- provider `name`
- provider `url`
- optional provider `apiKey`
- one or more custom model IDs per provider

Once saved, provider models appear in existing selectors like `/models` and `/subagents` and can be selected like built-in models.

Custom providers are stored in `settings.json` in the same app data directory. If you save an API key, it is stored locally in plaintext, so use a machine/user profile you trust.

### macOS sleep prevention

On macOS, Mastra Code starts the built-in `caffeinate` utility while the agent is actively running, then stops it as soon as the run completes, errors, aborts, or the TUI exits. Idle sessions do not keep your machine awake.

To disable this behavior, set `MASTRACODE_DISABLE_CAFFEINATE=1` before launching Mastra Code:

```bash
export MASTRACODE_DISABLE_CAFFEINATE=1
```

### Plan persistence

When you approve a plan (via `submit_plan`) or choose **Use as /goal** from the inline plan approval UI, it is saved as a markdown file in the app data directory:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/mastracode/plans/<resourceId>/`
- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/mastracode/plans/<resourceId>/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/mastracode/plans/<resourceId>/`

Files are named `<timestamp>-<slugified-title>.md` and contain the plan title, approval timestamp, and full plan body.

To save plans to a project-local directory instead, set the `MASTRA_PLANS_DIR` environment variable:

```bash
export MASTRA_PLANS_DIR=.mastracode/plans
```

### Web UI: optional auth & GitHub projects

The web UI (`mastracode web`) supports optional WorkOS authentication and a GitHub App
integration. Both are off by default — when their environment variables are absent the web UI
behaves exactly as before.

**WorkOS auth** — when `WORKOS_API_KEY` and `WORKOS_CLIENT_ID` are set, every route requires a
signed-in user (hosted login + encrypted session):

```bash
export WORKOS_API_KEY=...
export WORKOS_CLIENT_ID=...
export WORKOS_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-host/auth/callback   # optional
export WORKOS_COOKIE_PASSWORD=...                            # optional (recommended in prod)
```

On first authenticated use, a user with no WorkOS organization is automatically given a personal
org (the org is created and the user added as a member), so org-scoped features work without
hand-creating an org in the WorkOS dashboard. The WorkOS API key must be allowed to create
organizations and memberships; if it isn't, bootstrap fails soft (logged) and the user keeps the
`organization_required` response.

**GitHub projects** — when the GitHub App variables are set _and_ WorkOS auth is enabled,
signed-in users can install the GitHub App, pick repositories, and turn each repo into a project.
The tenant boundary is the **WorkOS organization**: the GitHub App installation and the connected
project (repo) are owned by the org, while each user inside the org gets their own isolated
sandbox, worktrees, branches, and PRs against that repo. The **same repo can be connected
independently by different orgs** without ever seeing each other's projects, sandboxes, or state.
Personal accounts are bootstrapped into a personal org on first use (see above), so they can
connect GitHub projects too; users always get isolated agent state regardless. Repo and project
metadata persist in a separate application Postgres (`APP_DATABASE_URL`):

```bash
export GITHUB_APP_ID=...
export GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
export GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID=...
export GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET=...
export GITHUB_APP_SLUG=your-app-slug
export APP_DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@host:5432/db
export GITHUB_APP_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-host/auth/github/callback  # optional
```

GitHub-backed projects are cloned into an isolated cloud sandbox on open, which requires a
sandbox provider. Railway is the first supported backend:

```bash
export RAILWAY_API_TOKEN=...
export RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT_ID=...
export MASTRACODE_SANDBOX_PROVIDER=railway                  # optional (default when a token is set)
export MASTRACODE_SANDBOX_WORKDIR=/workspace                # optional (path inside the sandbox)
export MASTRACODE_SANDBOX_IDLE_MINUTES=30                   # optional (idle teardown window; default 30)
```

The sandbox template must have `git` and `gh` (the GitHub CLI) installed and outbound network
access to `github.com`. `gh` is only required to open pull requests; clone/open work without it.
Idle sandboxes are stopped by the provider after `MASTRACODE_SANDBOX_IDLE_MINUTES`; the next open
detects the stopped VM and re-provisions automatically.
Without a sandbox provider, users can still connect GitHub and pick repos, but opening a repo
project shows a clear "sandbox not configured" error.

### Storage

All agent state (threads, messages, memory, observational memory, recall vectors) persists in the
single application Postgres (`APP_DATABASE_URL`) alongside the GitHub project metadata — one shared
database, with users separated by `resourceId` scoping. Without `APP_DATABASE_URL` (bare local
dev), agent state falls back to a local libSQL file.

### Multi-replica deployment

The web server serializes per-user git write operations. For hosted, multi-replica deployments a
few settings make this safe and bounded:

```bash
# Replica-stable state signing — REQUIRED across replicas. Without an explicit
# GITHUB_APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET (or WORKOS_COOKIE_PASSWORD) the OAuth/install state
# is signed with a per-process random key and callbacks fail on other replicas.
export GITHUB_APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET=...

# Cross-replica serialization of per-(project,user) git writes via Postgres
# advisory locks (default on, requires APP_DATABASE_URL). Set 0 for local dev.
export MASTRACODE_DISTRIBUTED_LOCK=1

# Per-replica cap on concurrently live sandboxes (0 / unset = unlimited).
export MASTRACODE_MAX_SANDBOXES=50
```

## Development

Mastra Code lives inside the [mastra monorepo](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra). All commands below assume you have cloned the repo and are in the repository root.

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies (from repo root)
pnpm i

# Build all packages (required before first run)
pnpm build
```

### Running from source

```bash
# Run the TUI directly via tsx (from repo root)
pnpx tsx mastracode/src/main.ts
```

### Building

```bash
# Build only the mastracode package (and its dependencies)
pnpm build:mastracode

# Build the library bundle (from mastracode/)
pnpm --filter ./mastracode run build:lib
```

### Type checking

```bash
# Type-check mastracode
pnpm --filter ./mastracode run check
```

### Linting

```bash
# Lint mastracode
pnpm --filter ./mastracode run lint
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run unit tests
pnpm --filter ./mastracode test

# Run e2e smoke tests
pnpm --filter ./mastracode run e2e:smoke
```

### Web UI development

```bash
# Start the web UI dev server (API + Vite)
pnpm --filter ./mastracode run web:dev

# With GitHub App integration (starts Postgres first)
pnpm --filter ./mastracode run web:dev:github
```
