## Digital Ocean

Deploy your Mastra applications to Digital Ocean's App Platform and Droplets.

<Callout>
  This guide assumes your Mastra application has been created using the default
  `npx create-mastra@latest` command.
  For more information on how to create a new Mastra application,
  refer to our [getting started guide](./../../getting-started/installation.mdx)
</Callout>

### App Platform

#### Prerequisites [#app-platform-prerequisites]

- A Git repository containing your Mastra application. This can be a GitHub repository, GitLab repository, or any other compatible source provider.
- A Digital Ocean account

#### Deployment Steps

<Steps>

#### Create a new App

- Log in to your Digital Ocean dashboard.
- Navigate to the App Platform service.
- Select your source provider and create a new app.

#### Configure Deployment Source

- Connect and select your repository. You may also choose a container image or a sample app.
- Select the branch you want to deploy from.
- Configure the source directory if necessary. If your Mastra application uses the default directory structure, no action is required here.
- Head to the next step.

#### Configure Resource Settings and Environment Variables

- A Node.js build should be detected automatically.
- Add any required environment variables for your Mastra application. This includes API keys, database URLs, and other configuration values.
- You may choose to configure the size of your resource here.
- Other things you may optionally configure include, the region of your resource, the unique app name, and what project the resource belongs to.
- Once you're done, you may create the app after reviewing your configuration and pricing estimates.

#### Deployment

- Your app will be built and deployed automatically.
- Digital Ocean will provide you with a URL to access your deployed application.

</Steps>

You can now access your deployed application at the URL provided by Digital Ocean.

<Callout>
The Digital Ocean App Platform uses an ephemeral file system,
meaning that any files written to the file system are short-lived and may be lost.
Avoid using a Mastra storage provider that uses the file system,
such as `LibSQLStore` with a file URL.

### Droplets

Deploy your Mastra application to Digital Ocean's Droplets.
This guide will cover setting up a droplet, a reverse proxy using Nginx, and running your Mastra application.

<Callout>
The guide assumes your droplet runs Ubuntu 24+.
</Callout>

#### Prerequisites [#droplets-prerequisites]

- A Digital Ocean account
- A droplet running Ubuntu 24+
- A domain name with an A record pointing to your droplet

#### Setting up the droplet

<ServerConfig />

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

### Connect to your Mastra server

You can now connect to your Mastra server from your client application using a `MastraClient` from the `@mastra/client-js` package.

Refer to the [`MastraClient` documentation](../../client-js/overview.mdx) for more information.

```typescript copy showLineNumbers
import { MastraClient } from "@mastra/client-js";

const mastraClient = new MastraClient({
  baseUrl: "https://<your-domain-name>",
});
```
