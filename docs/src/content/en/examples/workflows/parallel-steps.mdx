# Parallel Execution with Steps

When building AI applications, you often need to process multiple independent tasks simultaneously to improve efficiency.
We make this functionality a core part of workflows through the `.parallel` method.

## Setup

```sh copy
npm install @ai-sdk/openai @mastra/core
```

## Define Planning Agent

Define a planning agent which leverages an LLM call to plan activities given a location and corresponding weather conditions.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="agents/planning-agent.ts"
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

const llm = openai("gpt-4o");

// Define the planning agent with specific instructions for formatting
// and structuring weather-based activity recommendations
const planningAgent = new Agent({
  name: "planningAgent",
  model: llm,
  instructions: `
        You are a local activities and travel expert who excels at weather-based planning. Analyze the weather data and provide practical activity recommendations.

        📅 [Day, Month Date, Year]
        ═══════════════════════════

        🌡️ WEATHER SUMMARY
        • Conditions: [brief description]
        • Temperature: [X°C/Y°F to A°C/B°F]
        • Precipitation: [X% chance]

        🌅 MORNING ACTIVITIES
        Outdoor:
        • [Activity Name] - [Brief description including specific location/route]
          Best timing: [specific time range]
          Note: [relevant weather consideration]

        🌞 AFTERNOON ACTIVITIES
        Outdoor:
        • [Activity Name] - [Brief description including specific location/route]
          Best timing: [specific time range]
          Note: [relevant weather consideration]

        🏠 INDOOR ALTERNATIVES
        • [Activity Name] - [Brief description including specific venue]
          Ideal for: [weather condition that would trigger this alternative]

        ⚠️ SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
        • [Any relevant weather warnings, UV index, wind conditions, etc.]

        Guidelines:
        - Suggest 2-3 time-specific outdoor activities per day
        - Include 1-2 indoor backup options
        - For precipitation >50%, lead with indoor activities
        - All activities must be specific to the location
        - Include specific venues, trails, or locations
        - Consider activity intensity based on temperature
        - Keep descriptions concise but informative

        Maintain this exact formatting for consistency, using the emoji and section headers as shown.
      `,
});

export { planningAgent };
```

## Define Synthesize Agent

Define a synthesize agent which takes planned indoor and outdoor activities and provides a full report on the day.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="agents/synthesize-agent.ts"
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

const llm = openai("gpt-4o");

// Define the synthesize agent that combines indoor and outdoor activity plans
// into a comprehensive report, considering weather conditions and alternatives
const synthesizeAgent = new Agent({
  name: "synthesizeAgent",
  model: llm,
  instructions: `
  You are given two different blocks of text, one about indoor activities and one about outdoor activities.
  Make this into a full report about the day and the possibilities depending on whether it rains or not.
  `,
});

export { synthesizeAgent };
```

## Define Parallel Workflow

Here, we'll define a workflow which orchestrates a parallel -> sequential flow between the planning steps and the synthesize step.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="workflows/parallel-workflow.ts"
import { z } from "zod";
import { createStep, createWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows";

const forecastSchema = z.object({
  date: z.string(),
  maxTemp: z.number(),
  minTemp: z.number(),
  precipitationChance: z.number(),
  condition: z.string(),
  location: z.string(),
});

// Step to fetch weather data for a given city
// Makes API calls to get current weather conditions and forecast
const fetchWeather = createStep({
  id: "fetch-weather",
  description: "Fetches weather forecast for a given city",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    city: z.string(),
  }),
  outputSchema: forecastSchema,
  execute: async ({ inputData }) => {
    if (!inputData) {
      throw new Error("Trigger data not found");
    }

    const geocodingUrl = `https://geocoding-api.open-meteo.com/v1/search?name=${encodeURIComponent(inputData.city)}&count=1`;
    const geocodingResponse = await fetch(geocodingUrl);
    const geocodingData = (await geocodingResponse.json()) as {
      results: { latitude: number; longitude: number; name: string }[];
    };

    if (!geocodingData.results?.[0]) {
      throw new Error(`Location '${inputData.city}' not found`);
    }

    const { latitude, longitude, name } = geocodingData.results[0];

    const weatherUrl = `https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=${latitude}&longitude=${longitude}&current=precipitation,weathercode&timezone=auto,&hourly=precipitation_probability,temperature_2m`;
    const response = await fetch(weatherUrl);
    const data = (await response.json()) as {
      current: {
        time: string;
        precipitation: number;
        weathercode: number;
      };
      hourly: {
        precipitation_probability: number[];
        temperature_2m: number[];
      };
    };

    const forecast = {
      date: new Date().toISOString(),
      maxTemp: Math.max(...data.hourly.temperature_2m),
      minTemp: Math.min(...data.hourly.temperature_2m),
      condition: getWeatherCondition(data.current.weathercode),
      location: name,
      precipitationChance: data.hourly.precipitation_probability.reduce(
        (acc, curr) => Math.max(acc, curr),
        0,
      ),
    };

    return forecast;
  },
});
```

### Step to plan outdoor activities based on weather conditions

Uses the planning agent to generate activity recommendations

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="workflows/parallel-workflow.ts"
const planActivities = createStep({
  id: "plan-activities",
  description: "Suggests activities based on weather conditions",
  inputSchema: forecastSchema,
  outputSchema: z.object({
    activities: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ inputData, mastra }) => {
    const forecast = inputData;

    if (!forecast) {
      throw new Error("Forecast data not found");
    }

    const prompt = `Based on the following weather forecast for ${forecast.location}, suggest appropriate activities:
      ${JSON.stringify(forecast, null, 2)}
      `;

    const agent = mastra?.getAgent("planningAgent");
    if (!agent) {
      throw new Error("Planning agent not found");
    }

    const response = await agent.stream([
      {
        role: "user",
        content: prompt,
      },
    ]);

    let activitiesText = "";

    for await (const chunk of response.textStream) {
      process.stdout.write(chunk);
      activitiesText += chunk;
    }
    return {
      activities: activitiesText,
    };
  },
});
```

### Helper function to convert weather codes to human-readable conditions

Maps numeric codes from the weather API to descriptive strings

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="workflows/parallel-workflow.ts"
function getWeatherCondition(code: number): string {
  const conditions: Record<number, string> = {
    0: "Clear sky",
    1: "Mainly clear",
    2: "Partly cloudy",
    3: "Overcast",
    45: "Foggy",
    48: "Depositing rime fog",
    51: "Light drizzle",
    53: "Moderate drizzle",
    55: "Dense drizzle",
    61: "Slight rain",
    63: "Moderate rain",
    65: "Heavy rain",
    71: "Slight snow fall",
    73: "Moderate snow fall",
    75: "Heavy snow fall",
    95: "Thunderstorm",
  };
  return conditions[code] || "Unknown";
}

// Step to plan indoor activities as backup options
// Generates alternative indoor activities in case of bad weather
const planIndoorActivities = createStep({
  id: "plan-indoor-activities",
  description: "Suggests indoor activities based on weather conditions",
  inputSchema: forecastSchema,
  outputSchema: z.object({
    activities: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ inputData, mastra }) => {
    const forecast = inputData;

    if (!forecast) {
      throw new Error("Forecast data not found");
    }

    const prompt = `In case it rains, plan indoor activities for ${forecast.location} on ${forecast.date}`;

    const agent = mastra?.getAgent("planningAgent");
    if (!agent) {
      throw new Error("Planning agent not found");
    }

    const response = await agent.stream([
      {
        role: "user",
        content: prompt,
      },
    ]);

    let activitiesText = "";

    for await (const chunk of response.textStream) {
      activitiesText += chunk;
    }
    return {
      activities: activitiesText,
    };
  },
});
```

### Step to synthesize and combine indoor/outdoor activity plans

Creates a comprehensive plan that considers both options

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="workflows/parallel-workflow.ts"
const synthesizeStep = createStep({
  id: "sythesize-step",
  description: "Synthesizes the results of the indoor and outdoor activities",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    "plan-activities": z.object({
      activities: z.string(),
    }),
    "plan-indoor-activities": z.object({
      activities: z.string(),
    }),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    activities: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ inputData, mastra }) => {
    const indoorActivities = inputData?.["plan-indoor-activities"];
    const outdoorActivities = inputData?.["plan-activities"];

    const prompt = `Indoor activities:
      ${indoorActivities?.activities}
 
      Outdoor activities:
      ${outdoorActivities?.activities}
 
      There is a chance of rain so be prepared to do indoor activities if needed.`;

    const agent = mastra?.getAgent("synthesizeAgent");
    if (!agent) {
      throw new Error("Synthesize agent not found");
    }

    const response = await agent.stream([
      {
        role: "user",
        content: prompt,
      },
    ]);

    let activitiesText = "";

    for await (const chunk of response.textStream) {
      process.stdout.write(chunk);
      activitiesText += chunk;
    }

    return {
      activities: activitiesText,
    };
  },
});
```

### Main workflow

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="workflows/parallel-workflow.ts"
const activityPlanningWorkflow = createWorkflow({
  id: "plan-both-workflow",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    city: z.string(),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    activities: z.string(),
  }),
  steps: [fetchWeather, planActivities, planIndoorActivities, synthesizeStep],
})
  .then(fetchWeather)
  .parallel([planActivities, planIndoorActivities])
  .then(synthesizeStep)
  .commit();

export { activityPlanningWorkflow };
```

## Register Agent and Workflow instances with Mastra class

Register the agents and workflow with the mastra instance.
This is critical for enabling access to the agents within the workflow.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="index.ts"
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core/mastra";
import { createLogger } from "@mastra/core/logger";
import { activityPlanningWorkflow } from "./workflows/parallel-workflow";
import { planningAgent } from "./agents/planning-agent";
import { synthesizeAgent } from "./agents/synthesize-agent";

// Initialize Mastra with required agents and workflows
// This setup enables agent access within the workflow steps
const mastra = new Mastra({
  workflows: {
    activityPlanningWorkflow,
  },
  agents: {
    planningAgent,
    synthesizeAgent,
  },
  logger: createLogger({
    name: "Mastra",
    level: "info",
  }),
});

export { mastra };
```

## Execute the activity planning workflow

Here, we'll get the weather workflow from the mastra instance, then create a run and execute the created run with the required inputData.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="exec.ts"
import { mastra } from "./";

const workflow = mastra.getWorkflow("activityPlanningWorkflow");
const run = await workflow.createRunAsync();

// Execute the workflow with a specific city
// This will run through all steps and generate activity recommendations
const result = await run.start({ inputData: { city: "Ibiza" } });
console.dir(result, { depth: null });
```
