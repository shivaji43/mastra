# @mastra/discord

Discord channel wrapper for Mastra — a `ChannelProvider` (`@mastra/core/channels`) over **[`@chat-adapter/discord`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chat-adapter/discord)** (pinned to `4.40.0`), to parity with `@mastra/slack`.

The adapter already handles the Discord protocol (Ed25519 request verification, PING/PONG, deferrals, embeds + action-row buttons, the Gateway bridge, post-and-edit streaming). This package adds the install/lifecycle layer: the app-config + guild-keyed install store, an OAuth2 bot-invite `connect()`, guild/global slash-command registration, and Mastra route/stream wiring.

**Shape (how Discord differs from Slack/Telegram):** Discord has **no programmatic app creation** — apps are made in the Developer Portal. So there is no per-agent app factory: it's **one app, many guilds**. "Installing" is a **bot invite** (an OAuth2 authorize URL), not a token exchange — there is no per-install token to store. One bot token per application is reused across every guild, and tenancy is keyed by `guildId` per interaction.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @mastra/discord
```

Peer: `@mastra/core >= 1.22`.

## Usage

```ts
import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core';
import { DiscordProvider } from '@mastra/discord';

const discord = new DiscordProvider({
  // From the Developer Portal. Or set DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN / DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY /
  // DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID in the environment and omit this.
  app: {
    botToken: process.env.DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN!,
    publicKey: process.env.DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY!,
    applicationId: process.env.DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID!,
  },
  baseUrl: 'https://your-app.example.com', // for the interactions endpoint; auto-detected from the Mastra server if omitted
});

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: { support },
  channels: { discord },
});

// If the bot is already in DISCORD_GUILD_ID, this binds the agent to that
// guild and registers its commands immediately. Otherwise it returns an
// OAuth2 bot-invite URL and the install stays pending until the bot joins a
// guild — at which point the first interaction from that guild activates it.
const result = await discord.connect('support', {
  ...(process.env.DISCORD_GUILD_ID ? { guildId: process.env.DISCORD_GUILD_ID } : {}),
});
// → { type: 'immediate' }  OR  { type: 'oauth', authorizationUrl, installationId }
```

See [`example/discord-agent.ts`](./example/discord-agent.ts) for a full runnable sketch.

### Developer Portal setup

Discord apps are created in the [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), not via API. Once:

1. **Application** → copy the **Application ID** and **Public Key** (General Information).
2. **Bot** → add a bot, copy its **token**. Enable the **Message Content** / **Server Members** intents if you use DMs/mentions over the Gateway.
3. **Interactions Endpoint URL** → set it to `${baseUrl}/discord/events/<webhookId>`. After calling `connect(agentId)`, retrieve the `webhookId` by calling `getInstallation(agentId)` — it returns the full `DiscordInstallation` including `webhookId`. (`connect()` returns `installationId`, and `listInstallations()` returns public info without `webhookId`.) Discord sends a signed test PING on save; the adapter answers it — don't rewrite the response.

### The connect flow

`connect(agentId, options?)` returns a discriminated `ChannelConnectResult`:

| Call                                                                 | Result                                                | Meaning                                                                               |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `connect(id)`                                                        | `{ type: 'oauth', authorizationUrl, installationId }` | Open the URL, pick a server, authorize. The guild activates on the first interaction. |
| `connect(id, { guildId })` where the bot is **already** in `guildId` | `{ type: 'immediate' }`                               | Bound instantly; the guild's commands are registered.                                 |
| `connect(id, { guildId })` where it is **not**                       | `{ type: 'oauth', authorizationUrl, installationId }` | Falls back to the invite URL.                                                         |

The bot-invite URL _is_ an OAuth2 authorize URL (`scope=bot applications.commands` + a `permissions` bitfield), so completion is a browser redirect — hence the `oauth` variant. Re-connecting an already-active agent throws (disconnect first). To add another server, invite the bot with the existing URL — **new guilds activate on their first interaction** off the interaction's authoritative `guild_id`.

Credentials are validated (`GET /applications/@me`) **before** anything is persisted, so a bad token leaves no config or install behind. The bot token is the only secret; with an `encryptionKey` set it is AES-256-GCM encrypted at rest.

### Routing & the raw-body contract

The provider mounts **one** route, `POST /discord/events/:webhookId` (`requiresAuth: false` — Discord authenticates with Ed25519, not a bearer token). The handler passes the **raw request bytes** straight to `adapter.handleWebhook`; Ed25519 verification and PING/PONG live in the adapter.

> ⚠️ The Ed25519 signature is over `timestamp + raw body bytes`. Any middleware that parses and re-serializes the body (a JSON body-parser, `c.req.json()` then re-stringify) mutates the bytes and **every** signature fails. Don't put one in front of this route.

The mounted route only ever receives HTTP **Interactions** (PING, slash commands, buttons). DMs, @mentions and reactions arrive over the **Gateway**.

### The Gateway is core's job

For each adapter with `gateway !== false` (default `true`), `@mastra/core` owns the persistent Gateway WebSocket + its reconnection loop (`AgentChannels` → `startGatewayLoop`). This wrapper just sets `gateway: true` on the adapter entry — it never calls `startGatewayListener` and never runs a reconnect loop. Set `gateway: false` for serverless deployments that only need slash commands over HTTP.

Because core owns the loop (there is no `stopGatewayListener`), `disconnect()` removes the install row and drops the adapter entry but **cannot** kill an in-flight Gateway window — it lapses at the next duration boundary.

### Known caveat: reactions on a thread's starter message

An @mention in a channel opens a **new thread**, and Discord gives that thread an id equal to the starter message's id. `@chat-adapter/discord@4.40.0` handles this: when a reaction `PUT` against `/channels/{threadId}/messages/{messageId}/reactions/…` answers **404 `Unknown Message` (code 10008)** — the starter message is not a message _inside_ the thread, it is the message the thread hangs off — the adapter retries against the parent channel automatically. Replies were never affected: `AgentChannels` suppresses `tool-error` chunks for its own channel tools, so the agent's response still posts.

### Commands

Slash commands default to a single `/help` seed. Override per agent or provider-wide:

```ts
await discord.connect('support', {
  commands: ['/help', { name: 'ask', description: 'Ask a question' }],
});
```

Names are normalized to Discord's constraints (lowercase `[a-z0-9_-]`, 1-32 chars; description 1-100). Registration is scoped by `commandScope`:

- `'guild'` (default) — `PUT …/guilds/{id}/commands`, updates **instantly**, registered on each first-seen guild.
- `'global'` — `PUT …/commands`, eventually consistent, registered **once**.

Discord allows only **200 command creates per day, per guild**, so a per-scope content hash is tracked on the install and an unchanged command set is **not** re-registered.

### Streaming & ephemeral

Discord has no native token streaming. With `streaming: true` (default) the reply chunk-edits the interaction followup via the adapter's `editMessage` loop — throttle it with `streaming: { updateIntervalMs }` (Discord rate-limits edits). `typingStatus: true` (default) keeps a typing indicator alive. `toolDisplay` defaults to `'cards'` (Discord has native embeds + action-row buttons).

The deferred type-5 ACK is sent synchronously inside the 3-second window; the agent then runs in the background (under `waitUntil`) and posts into the 15-minute followup window. Ephemeral replies (flag 64) are locked at defer time — decide them via the `interactionFlags` callback (fired on the initial deferred response).

### Configuration

`new DiscordProvider(config)`:

| Option             | Default                                 | Notes                                                                                                  |

| `commandScope`     | `'guild'`                               | `'guild'` \| `'global'`.                                                                               |

### AgentChannels passthrough

These forward to the agent's `AgentChannels` (the same curated subset `@mastra/slack` exposes); each falls back to anything the agent author already configured:

| Option                            | Notes                                                                 |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `handlers`                        | Override `onDirectMessage` / `onMention` / `onSubscribedMessage`.     |
| `inlineMedia`                     | Which media types are sent inline to the model.                       |
| `inlineLinks`                     | Promote URLs in messages to file parts.                               |
| `tools`                           | Expose reaction tools (`add_reaction`/`remove_reaction`). Default on. |
| `state`                           | State adapter for dedup, locking, subscriptions.                      |
| `threadContext`                   | Fetch recent messages when joining a thread mid-conversation.         |
| `chatOptions`                     | Passthrough to the underlying Chat SDK.                               |
| `resolveResourceId`               | Choose memory ownership for a thread.                                 |
| `cors` / `formatError` / `logger` | Interactions-route CORS, error rendering, adapter logger.             |
| `resolveWaitUntil`                | Resolve `waitUntil` from the request context.                         |
| `onInstall`                       | Called after an agent connects and the install is persisted.          |

### Module format

Dual **ESM + CJS**, mirroring `@mastra/slack`. The ESM-only `@chat-adapter/discord` is kept external in the ESM build but bundled into the CJS output, so both `import` and `require('@mastra/discord')` work.

### Development

```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm test        # vitest, undici-mocked Discord REST + a signed Ed25519 PING→PONG
npm run build   # tsdown → dist (ESM + CJS + d.ts + d.cts)
```
