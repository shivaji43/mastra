/**
 * EventedAgent extends DurableAgent to use fire-and-forget execution.
 *
 * This agent type uses the built-in evented workflow engine, which is useful when:
 * - You don't need an external execution engine (like Inngest)
 * - You want fire-and-forget execution with pubsub streaming
 * - You need resumable streams with event caching
 * - You need runs to survive process death: an active run can be picked up by
 *   a fresh process over the same storage via `recover(runId)` /
 *   `recoverActiveRuns()` (running step state is persisted before execution)
 *
 * The key difference from DurableAgent is the execution strategy:
 * - DurableAgent: Runs the workflow synchronously via createRun + start
 * - EventedAgent: Starts the run without awaiting it (fire-and-forget); steps
 *   execute via events on `mastra.pubsub`, so any worker sharing that bus can
 *   process them. The agent's stream follows `mastra.pubsub`, so streaming,
 *   suspend/resume, and finish events work even when the agent was constructed
 *   with its own pubsub.
 *
 * Register the EventedAgent on a `Mastra` instance (with storage) to get
 * evented execution — the evented engine needs the host's pubsub, storage,
 * and event workers. Without a host, the agent falls back to the default
 * in-process engine (with a warning), preserving the released behavior of a
 * standalone evented agent. Recovery entry points (`recover`,
 * `listActiveRuns`, `recoverActiveRuns`) still require a host and throw
 * directly without one.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core';
 * import { Agent } from '@mastra/core/agent';
 * import { EventedAgent } from '@mastra/core/agent/durable';
 *
 * const agent = new Agent({
 *   id: 'my-agent',
 *   instructions: 'You are a helpful assistant',
 *   model: openai('gpt-4'),
 * });
 *
 * const eventedAgent = new EventedAgent({ agent });
 *
 * // Register on a Mastra host to get evented execution (a hostless agent
 * // falls back to the default in-process engine).
 * const mastra = new Mastra({
 *   agents: { myAgent: eventedAgent },
 *   storage: new LibSQLStore({ url: 'file:mastra.db' }),
 * });
 *
 * const { output, runId, cleanup } = await eventedAgent.stream('Hello!');
 * const text = await output.text;
 * cleanup();
 *
 * // After a crash/restart, a fresh process over the same storage can resume:
 * // await eventedAgent.recoverActiveRuns();
 * ```
