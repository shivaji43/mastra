 * - The default judge scorer always receives an isolated copy of the request
 *   context so judge-side mutations can't leak into the parent run
 *   (previously main-only).
 * - Judge activity streaming is wrapped so a scorer stream failure can't turn
 *   into an unhandled rejection (previously durable-only).
