'@mastra/railway': patch

Added support for booting new Railway sandboxes from a fallback checkpoint while keeping future snapshots isolated to the sandbox's own checkpoint.

```typescript
const sandbox = new RailwaySandbox({
  checkpointName: 'session-42',
  seedCheckpointName: 'repo-base',
});
```
