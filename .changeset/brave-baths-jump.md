'mastracode': patch

Quiet mode now trims `execute_command` entries and notifications, which previously ignored it. `execute_command` kept up to 15 lines of output in its terminal box while other tools collapsed to a single line; it now keeps the same box and follows the quiet preview line limit like every other tool: the command is always shown (long commands are capped at the limit) and only the last N lines of output appear under it, with hidden lines noted by a `⋯ (+N lines)` marker (when only one line would be hidden it is shown instead, since the marker costs the same row). Setting the limit to None shows the command alone. Expanding tool output (ctrl+e) reveals the full command and output. Notifications keep their bordered style but drop the priority/kind/status row and cap the message at the quiet preview line limit, and notification summaries drop the usage hint. Toggling quiet mode updates existing notifications live.
