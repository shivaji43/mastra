Each thing an agent does in a chat now renders as its own `Activity` line: every tool call, reasoning step, signal, notification, skill and plain "working" row. A body is optional. Without one, the line has no chevron and otherwise looks the same, so a step that returns nothing reads like one that does.

```tsx
import { ActivityItem } from '@mastra/playground-ui/components/ai/activity';
import { ToolCallOutput } from '@mastra/playground-ui/components/ai/tool-call';

<ActivityItem icon={<Sparkles aria-hidden />} label="Thinking" status="running" aria-label="Thinking" />;

<ActivityItem icon={<FileText aria-hidden />} label="Read file" detail="src/agent.ts" aria-label="Tool: view">
  <ToolCallOutput text={output} />
</ActivityItem>;
```

**The `ToolCall` shell is renamed to `Activity`**

The compound parts moved to `components/ai/activity` under new names: `ToolCall*` becomes `Activity*`, `ToolCallPresentedHeader` becomes `ActivityHeadline`, and `ToolCallStatus` becomes `ActivityStatus`. `ActivityHeadline` takes its icon as an element instead of a component, and keeps the `description` prop that shows a command's description in place of its label and detail. Its `disclosure` prop is removed: pass `foldable={false}` to `Activity` instead. The tool-specific blocks stay in `components/ai/tool-call`: `ToolCallArguments`, `ToolCallOutput`, `ToolCallCommand`, `ToolCallGroup` and `presentTool`.

```tsx
// Before
import {
  ToolCall,
  ToolCallTrigger,
  ToolCallPresentedHeader,
  ToolCallContent,
} from '@mastra/playground-ui/components/ai/tool-call';

<ToolCall status={status}>
  <ToolCallTrigger>
    <ToolCallPresentedHeader icon={Search} label={label} detail={detail} />
  </ToolCallTrigger>
  <ToolCallContent>{body}</ToolCallContent>
</ToolCall>;

// After
import {
  Activity,
  ActivityTrigger,
  ActivityHeadline,
  ActivityContent,
} from '@mastra/playground-ui/components/ai/activity';

<Activity status={status}>
  <ActivityTrigger>
    <ActivityHeadline icon={<Search aria-hidden />} label={label} detail={detail} />
  </ActivityTrigger>
  <ActivityContent>{body}</ActivityContent>
</Activity>;
```

The screen-reader status text is now "Running" or "Failed" instead of "Tool call running" or "Tool call failed", because the line is no longer only for tools.

**Signals, notifications and reasoning are `Activity` presets**

`components/ai/chat-event` is removed. Its presets moved into `components/ai/activity` and are named after the line they draw: `ChatSignal` is now `SignalActivity` and `ChatNotification` is now `NotificationActivity`. Each one picks the icon, badges and body for one kind of event over `ActivityItem`.

The card presentation of signals and the notice presentation of notifications are removed along with their `variant` prop and `getNotificationNoticeVariant`. A notification's priority is now a coloured badge on the line: urgent is red, high is orange, medium is blue. Its status and pending count are badges beside it. A system reminder names its path as the detail of the line.

```tsx
// Before
import { ChatNotification } from '@mastra/playground-ui/components/ai/chat-event';

<ChatNotification variant="notice" label="github / issue-opened" message={message} priority="high" />;

// After
import { NotificationActivity } from '@mastra/playground-ui/components/ai/activity';

<NotificationActivity label="github / issue-opened" message={message} priority="high" />;
```

`Reasoning` moved out of `domains/chat/messages/reasoning` and joins them as `ReasoningActivity`, with the same props. `hasVisibleReasoning` answers whether it would render anything, so a transcript can skip an empty reasoning part without drawing it. `ReasoningStreamingLine` is removed: `ReasoningActivity` covers the waiting state itself, and while it streams with no text yet, it shows a busy "Reasoning" line with no disclosure.

```tsx
// Before
import { Reasoning } from '@mastra/playground-ui/domains/chat/messages/reasoning';

<Reasoning text={text} streaming />;

// After
import { ReasoningActivity } from '@mastra/playground-ui/components/ai/activity';

<ReasoningActivity text={text} streaming />;
```

**A line only folds when its body says more than the line**

A short single-line message fits in the preview, so opening a disclosure used to reveal a copy of the line above it. Such a line now has no disclosure and wraps its detail instead of clipping it, so a narrow transcript never hides the end of a sentence it offers no way to open. Because folding is now the exception, a line that folds shows a dimmed chevron at rest instead of only on hover.

Notification badges wrap in narrow transcripts without squeezing the message out. Linked notifications keep their full message in the expanded body. Expanded messages preserve line breaks and wrap long URLs. A notification link is now announced by its visible text followed by the message preview, for example "Open on GitHub: The pull request was merged…", so voice control can open it by what it says.

The same rule covers a composed `Activity`: pass `foldable={false}` when there is nothing to open, and the line drops its disclosure button and its empty body. A tool call with no arguments, no output and no result is one example, and so is a call whose arguments are an empty object. `hasToolArguments` tells you whether `ToolCallArguments` would render anything, and `awaitsToolApproval` tells you whether `ToolApprovalButtons` would.

```tsx
import {
  Activity,
  ActivityContent,
  ActivityHeadline,
  ActivityTrigger,
} from '@mastra/playground-ui/components/ai/activity';
import { hasToolArguments, ToolCallArguments, ToolCallOutput } from '@mastra/playground-ui/components/ai/tool-call';

const foldable = hasToolArguments({ toolName, args }) || output !== undefined;

<Activity foldable={foldable} status={status}>
  <ActivityTrigger>
    <ActivityHeadline icon={<Search aria-hidden />} label={label} detail={detail} />
  </ActivityTrigger>
  <ActivityContent>
    <ToolCallArguments toolName={toolName} args={args} />
    {output !== undefined && <ToolCallOutput text={output} />}
  </ActivityContent>
</Activity>;
```

A line that gains a body as its arguments stream in keeps its headline mounted: its shimmer does not restart, its detail does not fade in again, and the chevron fades into a slot that was already reserved, so the text does not shift sideways.

Because the disclosure button now lies over the whole line, put anything that needs its own hover, such as a timestamp with a `title`, in `ActivityLeading`. It stays reachable above the button, so the tooltip still shows, and a click on it still opens the line. `ActivityHeadline` and `ToolCallGroup` already wrap their `leading` content in it. `ActivityTrigger` is now a wrapper around that button rather than the button itself, so props such as `onClick` or `disabled` no longer reach it: drive the line through `open`, `onOpenChange` and `foldable` on `Activity`.

**`ChatTimeGap` is replaced by `TranscriptDivider`**

The transcript separator is a `role="separator"` rule, not an event, and it no longer parses a time string. It takes the label and, separately, the timestamp that belongs in `title`, and renders nothing when the label is empty.

```tsx
// Before
import { ChatTimeGap } from '@mastra/playground-ui/components/ai/chat-event';

<ChatTimeGap text="24 minutes later — Sep 17, 2026, 2:24 PM" />;

// After
import { TranscriptDivider } from '@mastra/playground-ui/components/ai/transcript-divider';

<TranscriptDivider label="24 minutes later" title="Sep 17, 2026, 2:24 PM" />;
```

`ChatSkill` is removed: the Factory was its only consumer, so it now composes `ActivityItem` itself.

`SignalActivity` and `NotificationActivity` no longer set their own width or vertical margin, so the caller places them.

**Studio draws workspace and memory steps as `Activity` lines too**

Listing files, running a sandbox command and observational memory used to render their own cards, so a group of tool calls mixed two styles. They now use the same line as every other tool call. A listing shows its path on the line, and its summary and filesystem link beside it. A sandbox command shows its command on the line, and its sandbox link, exit status and duration beside it. The sandbox link is no longer nested inside the toggle button. A sandbox command now starts folded like any other call, unless it waits for approval. An observation or reflection shows its token counts on the line and keeps its observations, current task, suggested response and extractions in the body. A failed one is a failed line.
