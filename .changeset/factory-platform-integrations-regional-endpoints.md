Switched the default platform integrations endpoint used by `PlatformGithubIntegration` and `PlatformLinearIntegration` from `https://platform.mastra.ai/v1` to `https://integrations.mastra.ai`, and added `MASTRA_PLATFORM_REGION` support. Set it to `us` or `eu` (case-insensitive) to route to the regional replica at `https://integrations.us.mastra.ai` or `https://integrations.eu.mastra.ai`.

Endpoint resolution precedence: `MASTRA_INTEGRATIONS_API_URL` (dedicated integrations override) > `MASTRA_PLATFORM_REGION` > global default. `MASTRA_SHARED_API_URL` configures the shared platform API and does not affect integrations routing. A trailing `/v1` on the override is stripped, so version-suffixed URLs keep working unchanged.

Migration:

```bash
# Before (implicit default)
# https://platform.mastra.ai/v1

# After (implicit default)
# https://integrations.mastra.ai

# Route platform integrations to a regional replica
export MASTRA_PLATFORM_REGION=us

# Keep the previous route (e.g. pinned deployments)
export MASTRA_INTEGRATIONS_API_URL=https://platform.mastra.ai/v1
```
