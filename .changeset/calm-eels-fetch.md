Added a public `sandboxId` getter to `RailwaySandbox` that exposes the physical Railway VM id. Persist it and pass it back via the `sandboxId` option to reattach to the same VM on resume instead of provisioning a replacement.

```ts
const id = sandbox.sandboxId; // persist after start()
const resumed = new RailwaySandbox({ sandboxId: id });
```
